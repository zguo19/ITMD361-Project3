    <h2>Introduction: </h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my page. </p>
    <p>I am a college student at Illinois Institute of Technology major in Computer Science. This already my third year here
      in Chicago, and I really like this city.
    </p>
    <p>My dream is to be a good and kind person, and stay strong no matter what happened in my life. </p>
    <p>I am also very into music, the song playing on this site is one of my favorite Chinese song</p>
    <p>I like cute animals such as cats, bunnies, and baby pandas</p>
    <p>During my spare time, I usually watch TV shows online, I have mixed tastes about TV shows, but thrills and detective
      are always my favorite.
